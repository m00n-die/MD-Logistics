# MD Logistics
MD Logistics is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that manages the inventory of a business.
It is created as a free alternative for small businesses to effectively manage their inventory.

## THE PROBLEM
Most small to medium sized businesses still rely on paper records to manage and run their bsuinesses. This is not the best way to go about it as these records could easily be damaged or get lost, the main issue here is most Inventory Management Systems aren't built with these businesses in mind. In their pricing and then implementation so these business owners have no other choice but to use the old way of keeping records on paper.

## THE SOLUTION
MD Logistics has been built to address this issue. It is an Open Source Apllication built and mainatined by fellow developers with the aim of making the lives of small to medium sized business easier. The software application is completely free and does not require any advanced knowledege of computers to use. Anyone with a basic unbderstanding of the English Language can use it effectively.

## STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT
MD Logistsics is going to be built in two main phases. CLI Phase and the GUI Phase. The application is still in the development processs but stable relases will be avialable at regular intervals.

### CLI Phase
The CLI phase is the first phase to be built. In this phase, the main logic of the application is going to be built. It is essentially going to be the backend of the application, handling the logic, interascting with the databases among others.

### GUI Phase
This is the second and final phase of the development process. This is where the GUI or UI of the application will be built.
